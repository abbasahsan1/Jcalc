# 🖼 Jahez Calculator – UI Design Document

## ✨ Design Philosophy

**Modern Desi Fusion**
The UI should feel like a **digital extension of the rishta culture** — warm, relatable, humorous, yet intuitive and sleek. The visual identity must capture the **cultural nuance of Pakistan** while delivering a polished, tech-forward experience.

Inspiration:

- Pakistani wedding invites
- Mehndi color palettes
- Truck art motifs (sparingly)
- Modern fintech/quiz-style UIs
