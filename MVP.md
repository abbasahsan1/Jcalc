# üéØ Jahez Calculator ‚Äî MVP Specification

**Tagline:** *‚ÄúJahez ka Andaaza ‚Äî Rishta Market ki Science par Mabni‚Äù*
**Purpose:** A satirical but data-driven tool that estimates the expected dowry (Jahez) a man might receive, based on his personal profile, in the context of **Pakistani rishta culture**.

---

## üáµüá∞ Contextual Premise:

Jahez expectations, though socially discouraged and legally controversial, are often **unspoken but heavily implied** in Pakistani marriages ‚Äî especially in upper-middle and rural families. Factors such as **foreign income, education, caste, social status**, and even **physical appearance** play a strong role in determining **what kind of dowry is expected or demanded**, particularly in **arranged marriages**. The calculator presents these expectations as **categorized items**, reflecting real practices across regions.
